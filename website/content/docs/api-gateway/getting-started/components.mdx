# Components

## GatewayClass

`GatewayClass` describes a class of `Gateway` that fulfills the [Kubernetes Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/).
The `GatewayClass` indicates what type of `Gateway` is meant to be used. For the purposes of this documentation, we always
want to use a Consul API Gateway and so will specify the `consul-api-gateway` gateway class that is created by the Consul Helm chart.
Using this class indicates that the Consul API Gateway controller is responsible for creating the required infrastructure resources
and configuring them appropriately, resulting in a functional `Gateway`.

Though Consul API Gateway doesn't offer it today, it's possible for a single controller to be responsible for multiple `GatewayClasses`.
This can serve multiple high-level use cases with a gateway class specific to each use case. For example, you may have two `GatewayClasses`:

1. `internet` for `Gateways` intended for public-facing applications
1. `private` for `Gateways` intended for internal applications

## GatewayClassConfig

`GatewayClassConfig` is a component that enables Consul-specific configuration for the `Gateway`. Since the `GatewayClass`
is generic and only describes the type of `Gateway` implementation that you'd like to use, the `GatewayClassConfig` houses
configuration that may not apply to other implementations of the [Kubernetes Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/)
but applies to your desired implementation, Consul API Gateway.

## Gateway

A `Gateway` consists of a load balancer that distributes requests across one-to-many instances. Having multiple instances increases our availability
and ability to scale. A `Gateway` can specify multiple listeners that each include a port and a protocol. Each instance that the load balancer
distributes requests to will have all configured listener(s) available on the designated port and with the designated protocol.

Each listener can have multiple routes attached to it. Routes are matched based on a specific set of rules. For more information on these rules, please
see [TODO](). Each listener can match all hostnames - the default behavior - or specify a virtual hostname for matching.

Once the `Gateway` is ready, it will have a publicly-accessible IP address assigned to it. You may also choose to set a hostname on each listener.

## HTTPRoute

A `HTTPRoute` provides a way to route HTTP requests from a listener on a `Gateway` to a set of backends. `HTTPRoutes` must specify:

1. The `Gateway` (or "parent") that the route is intended to attach to
1. A list of rules that determine which requests match this route based on path, header, or query parameter

Optionally, a route can specify a virtual hostname that must match in order for the route to apply. If no hostname is specified, matching is done
for every request against the list of rules.

Optionally, a `HTTPRoute` can include filters to specify additional processing steps such as adding a header to the request.

## TCPRoute

A `TCPRoute` provides a way to route TCP requests from a listener on a `Gateway` to a set of backends. `TCPRoutes` must specify:

1. The `Gateway` (or "parent") that the route is intended to attach to
1. A list of rules that determine which requests match this route based on path, header, or query parameter

Optionally, a `TCPRoute` can include filters to specify additional processing steps such as adding a header to the request.
