# Components

## GatewayClass

`GatewayClass` describes a class of `Gateway` that fulfills the [Kubernetes Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/).
The `GatewayClass` indicates what type of `Gateway` is meant to be used. For the purposes of this documentation, we always
want to use a Consul API Gateway and so will specify the `consul-api-gateway` class that is created by the Consul Helm chart.

## GatewayClassConfig

`GatewayClassConfig` is a component that enables Consul-specific configuration for the `Gateway`. Since the `GatewayClass`
is generic and only describes the type of `Gateway` implementation that you'd like to use, the `GatewayClassConfig` houses
configuration that may not apply to other implementations of the [Kubernetes Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/)
but applies to your desired implementation, Consul API Gateway.
