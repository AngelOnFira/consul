# Components

## GatewayClass

`GatewayClass` describes a class of `Gateway` that fulfills the [Kubernetes Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/).
The `GatewayClass` indicates what type of `Gateway` is meant to be used. For the purposes of this documentation, we always
want to use a Consul API Gateway and so will specify the `consul-api-gateway` gateway class that is created by the Consul Helm chart.
Using this class indicates that the Consul API Gateway controller is responsible for creating the required infrastructure resources
and configuring them appropriately, resulting in a functional `Gateway`.

Though Consul API Gateway doesn't offer it today, it's possible for a single controller to be responsible for multiple `GatewayClasses`.
This can serve multiple high-level use cases with a gateway class specific to each use case. For example, you may have two `GatewayClasses`:

1. `internet` for `Gateways` used for public-facing applications and
2. `private` for `Gateway` that  internal applications

## GatewayClassConfig

`GatewayClassConfig` is a component that enables Consul-specific configuration for the `Gateway`. Since the `GatewayClass`
is generic and only describes the type of `Gateway` implementation that you'd like to use, the `GatewayClassConfig` houses
configuration that may not apply to other implementations of the [Kubernetes Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/)
but applies to your desired implementation, Consul API Gateway.
