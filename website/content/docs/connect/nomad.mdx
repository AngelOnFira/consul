# Consul Service Mesh on Nomad

Consul service mesh can be used with [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io) to provide
secure service-to-service communication between Nomad jobs and task groups.
Nomad is a simple, flexible scheduler and workload orchestrator. Consul's ability
to leverage Nomad's [dynamic port](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/network#dynamic-ports)
feature reduces the operational complexity of Nomad.
