# Consul Service Mesh

Consul service mesh can help you secure and observe your
service-to-service communications without modifying your services.
It provides service-to-service connection authorization and encryption
using mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS). Services can join the mesh
without modification by deploying a [sidecar proxy](/docs/connect/proxies).
Services may also [natively integrate with the Consul server mesh](/docs/connect/native)
for niche use cases.

Review the video below to learn more about Consul service mesh from HashiCorp's co-founder Armon.

## Application Security

Consul service mesh enables secure deployment best-practices with automatic
service-to-service encryption, and identity-based authorization.
It uses the registered service identity (rather than IP addresses) to
enforce access control with [intentions](/docs/connect/intentions). This
makes it easier to reason about access control and enables services to be
rescheduled by orchestrators including Kubernetes and Nomad. Intention
enforcement is network agnostic, so the service mesh works with physical networks,
cloud networks, software-defined networks, cross-cloud, and more.

## Observability

One of the key benefits of Consul service mesh is the uniform and consistent view it
provides of all the services on your network, irrespective of their different
programming languages and frameworks. The Envoy sidecar proxies for each service in the mesh
"see" all service-to-service traffic and can collect data about it.
Consul can configure these sidecar proxies to collect
layer 7 metrics and export them to tools like Prometheus. Correctly instrumented
applications can also send open tracing data through Envoy.

## Getting Started ((#getting-started-with-connect))

There are several ways to try Consul service mesh in different environments.

- The [Getting Started with Consul Service Mesh collection](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/service-mesh?utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS)
  walks you through installing Consul as service mesh for Kubernetes using the Helm
  chart, deploying services in the service mesh, and using intentions to secure service
  communications.

- The [Secure Service-to-Service Communication tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/service-mesh-with-envoy-proxy?utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS)
  is a simple walk through of connecting two services on your local machine
  using Envoy as a sidecar proxy and configuring your first intention.

- The [Kubernetes tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/kubernetes-minikube?utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS)
  walks you through configuring Consul service mesh in Kubernetes using the Helm
  chart, and using intentions. You can run the guide on Minikube or an existing
  Kubernetes cluster.

- The [observability tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/kubernetes-layer7-observability?utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS)
  shows how to deploy a basic metrics collection and visualization pipeline on
  a Minikube or Kubernetes cluster using the official Helm charts for Consul,
  Prometheus, and Grafana.
