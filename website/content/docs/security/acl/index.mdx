# ACL System

The Consul Access Control List (ACL) system authenticates requests and authorizes
access to resources. It is used by the UI, API, CLI, service-to-service
communication, and agent-to-agent communication.

This page will introduce you to all of the core concepts of the ACL system. For a more
step-to-step guide see [Bootstrap and Explore ACLs] for getting started with ACLs and
[Secure Consul with ACLs] for configuring ACLs in a production environment.

[Secure Consul with ACLs]: https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/access-control-setup-production?utm_source=consul.io&utm_medium=docs

See also the [ACL API reference](/api-docs/acl), [ACL CLI reference](/commands/acl), and
[Troubleshoot the ACL System](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/access-control-troubleshoot).
The ACL system can be enabled and configured using the [acl stanza](/docs/agent/options#acl)
in the agent configuration file.


## Overview

The diagram below shows the relationships between the core components of the ACL system:

![ACL system component relationships](/img/acl-token-policy-rule-relationship.png)

[Tokens](/docs/security/acl/tokens) are the core method of authentication in Consul.
Permissions are granted to a token by linking it to
[policies](/docs/security/acl/policies), and
[roles](/docs/security/acl/policies#roles). Policies are constructed from a set of
[rules](/docs/security/acl/rules).

Tokens can be created directly from the [CLI](/commands/acl/token) or [API](/api-docs/acl/tokens).
[Auth Methods](/docs/security/acl/auth-methods) can be used to dynamically create tokens
from a trusted external system.

### Legacy ACL System

The ACL system in Consul 1.3.1 and older is now called legacy. For information
on bootstrapping the legacy system, ACL rules, and a general ACL system
overview, read the legacy [documentation](/docs/security/acl/acl-legacy). The
legacy ACL system was removed in Consul 1.11.

Legacy ACL tokens can be migrated to the new system by following the
[legacy token migration documentation](/docs/acl/acl-migrate-tokens).
