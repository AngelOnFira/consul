# ACL System

The Consul Access Control List (ACL) system authenticates requests and authorizes
access to resources. It is used by the UI, API, CLI, service-to-service
communication, and agent-to-agent communication.

This page will introduce you to all of the core concepts of the ACL system. For a more
step-to-step guide see [Bootstrap and Explore ACLs] for getting started with ACLs and
[Secure Consul with ACLs] for configuring ACLs in a production environment.

[Secure Consul with ACLs]: https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/access-control-setup-production?utm_source=consul.io&utm_medium=docs

See also the [ACL API reference](/api-docs/acl), [ACL CLI reference](/commands/acl), and
[Troubleshoot the ACL System](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/access-control-troubleshoot).
The ACL system can be enabled and configured using the [acl stanza](/docs/agent/options#acl)
in the agent configuration file.


## Overview

The diagram below shows the relationships between the core components of the ACL system:

## Tokens

Tokens are the core method of authentication in Consul. The `SecretID` of the token
(often referred to as the ACL token) is an opaque string that is included in requests to
identify the person or system making the request. The ACL system will look up the ACL
token and grant or deny access based on the permissions associated with the token.
Permissions are granted to a token by linking it to [policies](#policies), [roles](#roles),
[service identities](#service-identities), and [node identities](#node-identities).

A Token also has an Accessor ID which is used in [Audit Logging](/docs/enterprise/audit-logging)
and API responses to identify the token without revealing the secret ID.

Tokens can be created directly from the [CLI](/commands/acl/token) or [API](/api-docs/acl/tokens).
[Auth Methods](/docs/security/acl/auth-methods) can be used to dynamically create tokens
from a trusted external system.

Consul HTTP API requests accept a token from an [HTTP Header](/api-docs/index#authentication),
and CLI requests accept a token from
[`-token` command line flag](/commands#authentication) or
[`CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN_FILE` environment variable](/commands#consul_http_token_file).

### ACL Auth Methods

An auth method is a component in Consul that performs authentication against a
trusted external party to authorize the creation of an ACL tokens usable within
the local datacenter. Read the ACL auth method
[documentation](/docs/acl/auth-methods) to learn more about how they
work and why you may want to use them.

### ACL Legacy System

The ACL system in Consul 1.3.1 and older is now called legacy. For information
on bootstrapping the legacy system, ACL rules, and a general ACL system
overview, read the legacy [documentation](/docs/acl/acl-legacy).

### ACL Migration

[The migration documentation](/docs/acl/acl-migrate-tokens) details how to
upgrade existing legacy tokens after upgrading to 1.4.0. It will briefly
describe what changed, and then walk through the high-level migration process
options, finally giving some specific examples of migration strategies. The new
ACL system has improvements for the security and management of ACL tokens and
policies.
