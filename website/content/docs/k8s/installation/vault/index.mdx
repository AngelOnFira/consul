# Vault as Secrets Backend Overview

By default, Consul Helm chart will expect that any credentials it needs are stored as Kubernetes secrets.
As of Consul 1.11 and Consul Helm chart v0.?.?, we integrate more natively with Vault making it easier
to use Consul Helm chart with Vault as the secrets storage backend.

At a high level, there are two points of integration with Vault:
- **Gossip encryption** - The encryption key for gossip communication is stored in Vault.
- **TLS certificates and keys**:
  - **Consul Server TLS credentials** - TLS certificate and key for the Consul server is stored in Vault
  - **Service Mesh and Consul client TLS credentials** - Consul uses Vault as the provider for mTLS certificates and keys for the service mesh services
  and TLS certificates and keys for the Consul clients.
