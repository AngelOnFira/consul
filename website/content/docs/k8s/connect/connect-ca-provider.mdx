# Configuring a Connect CA Provider

~> NOTE: Instructions below should only be used for initially bootstrapping a cluster.
To update the Connect CA provider on an existing cluster or to update any properties, such as tokens, of the CA provider,
please use the [Update CA Configuration Endpoint](/api/connect/ca#update-ca-configuration).

Consul has support for different certificate authority (CA) providers to be used with the Consul Service Mesh.
Please see [Connect Certificate Management](/docs/connect/ca) for the information on the providers
we currently support.

To configure a provider via the Consul Helm chart, you need to follow three steps:

1. Create a configuration file containing your provider information.
1. Create a Kubernetes secret containing the configuration file.
1. Reference the Kubernetes secret in the [`server.extraVolumes`](/docs/k8s/helm#v-server-extravolumes) value in the Helm chart.
