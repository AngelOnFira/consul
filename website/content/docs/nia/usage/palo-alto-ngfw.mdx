# Automate Palo Alto NGFW with Consul-Terraform-Sync

This topic describes how to automatically configure your Palo Alto Next-Generation Firewall's (NGFW) dynamic address group using Terraform and Consul.

## Overview
You can use Consul-Terraform-Sync (CTS) for network infrastructure automation (NIA). This enables you to automatically update your infrastructure and network devices using Terraform whenever your service networking control plane (Consul) changes.

The following image shows the basic architecture of an NIA setup with Palo Alto NGFW.

![NIA CTS with Palo Alto NGFW architecture diagram](/img/nia/palo_alto_architecture_diagram.png)
 
Complete the following steps to configure your NGFW:

1. Configure a dynamic address group (DAG)
1. Register your Consul services
1. Configure CTS
1. Start CTS
1. Verify NIA workflow

## Requirements

1. A [Palo Alto NGFW](#palo-alto-ngfw)
1. A [Consul datacenter](#consul) for service networking and service mesh
1. A server with [Consul-Terraform-Sync (CTS)](#consul-terraform-sync) installed. This server must be able to communicate with the NGFW and the Consul datacenter.
1. Two servers running a web service on port 80

In addition, it assumes you are familiar with the standard Consul workflow and CTS. If you are unfamiliar with these topics, reference their respective tutorials to learn more.

- Complete the [Get Started with Consul on VMs](/consul/tutorials/get-started-vms) or [Get Started with Consul on Kubernetes](/consul/tutorials/get-started-kubernetes) tutorials to learn more about Consul.
- Complete the [Network Infrastructure Automation with Consul-Terraform-Sync Intro](/consul/tutorials/network-infrastructure-automation/consul-terraform-sync-intro) tutorial to learn more about CTS.

### Palo Alto NGFW

These instructions support [Palo Alto NGFW](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/next-generation-firewall) and other and other PAN OS-based devices.

Configure your Palo Alto NGFW dynamic address group (DAG). The following minimal example defines a DAG named `web` with a matching selection for `'web'`, enabling CTS to automatically register or deregister the web server resources. Refer to the [Palo Alto documentation](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/security-policy/objects/address-groups/dynamic-address-groups) for additional information about dynamic address groups.

### Consul

Confirm that you have deployed the web services and the respective servers have Consul agents running on them.

``` shell-session
$ consul members
Node              Address             Status  Type    Build   Protocol  DC   Segment
consul-server     10.88.0.100:8301    alive   server  1.14.1  2         dc1  <all>
web-1             10.88.0.102:8301    alive   client  1.14.1  2         dc1  <default>
web-2             10.88.0.103:8301    alive   client  1.14.1  2         dc1  <default> 
```

Once Consul is deployed and all agents have joined the datacenter, it is time to prepare CTS.

- CTS requires access to the Consul catalog. 
- If you're using Consul as a Terraform backend, you will also need privileges to store the Terraform state into Consul's key-value (KV) store.
- In production environments, we recommend enabling access control lists (ACLs) on Consul. In order for CTS to retrieve information from Consul, it must pass a token in its configuration. Refer to the [production CTS tutorial](/consul/tutorials/network-infrastructure-automation/consul-terraform-sync-secure) for more information about ACL tokens and an example of a secure CTS configuration.

### Consul-Terraform-Sync

CTS is a tool that uses Consul's service catalog as a source of truth for all applications running in a given environment. When it detects changes to the services (e.g. a new service node is added or deleted from the service list), CTS dynamically applies the necessary changes to your infrastructure using Terraform, in this case, the NGFW's dynamic address group.

The [`dag-nia`](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/PaloAltoNetworks/dag-nia/panos/latest) Terraform module, a Palo Alto Networks managed Terraform module for CTS, lets operators automate their network infrastructure by dynamically configuring address groups and dynamic address tags. Once configured, CTS will register or deregister address group IP tags based on changes to the respective services in Consul.

The following diagram shows an example network infrastructure automation (NIA) workflow with Terraform, Consul, CTS, and Palo Alto NGFW.

![NIA CTS with PAN NGFW workflow](/img/nia/palo_alto_ngfw_workflow.png)

~> **Compatibility Note:** CTS requires Terraform 0.13 or later to operate. You can either install Terraform before starting CTS or let the CTS install a compatible Terraform version for you.

## Register your Consul services

Before you can use CTS, you must register your services to Consul.

For each service, create a service configuration file with information about the service (for example, IP, port, etc), and health check information. The service name must match the `service-group` name defined on the Palo Alto NGFW.

Refer to the [service registration usage docs](/consul/docs/discovery/services) to learn how to register Consul services.

Select a tab for an example service configuration in HCL or JSON.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="HCL" group="hcl">

Create a service configuration file with the following details named `web.hcl`.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="web.hcl">

```hcl
service {
  name = "web"
  port = 80
  check {
    id = "web
    name = "web TCP check"
    tcp = "localhost:80"
    interval = "10s"
    timeout = "1s"
  }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Once you have created the configuration file, register the service with Consul.

```shell-session
$ consul services register web.hcl
```

</Tab>

<Tab heading="JSON" group="json">

Create a service configuration file with the following details named `web.json`.


<CodeBlockConfig filename="web.json">

```json
{
  "service": {
    "name": "web",
    "port": 80,
    "checks": [
      {
        "id": "web",
        "name": "web TCP Check",
        "tcp": "localhost:80",
        "interval": "10s",
        "timeout": "1s"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Once you have created the configuration file, register the service with Consul.

```shell-session
$ consul services register web.json
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

Reload the Consul dashboard to find the newly registered Consul services.

## Configure CTS

CTS expects to run a set of tasks whenever a service is registered or removed from Consul. Create a CTS configuration file that defines these tasks. The following is an example CTS configuration file. Update the values for the `consul` and `panos` providers to match your environment.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="tasks.hcl">

```hcl
log_level = "info"

driver "terraform" {
  log = true
  required_providers {
    panos = {
      source = "PaloAltoNetworks/panos"
    }
  }
}

consul {
  address = "localhost:8500"
}

terraform_provider "panos" {
  alias = "panos1" 
  address  = "10.64.4.104"
  username = "admin"
}

task {
  name = "Create_DAG_on_PANOS1"
  description = "Automate Dynamic Address Groups based on service definition"
  providers = ["panos.panos1"]
  module = "github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/terraform-panos-dag-nia"
  condition "services" {
    names = ["web"]
  }
  variable_files = []
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The driver defines all Terraform providers required to execute the task. This specific configuration requires the `PaloAltoNetworks/panos` provider.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="tasks.hcl" hideClipboard highlight="5">

```hcl
driver "terraform" {
  log = true
  required_providers {
    panos = {
      source = "PaloAltoNetworks/panos"
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The `terraform_provider` specifies the parameters to interact with the Palo Alto NGFW.

~> **Security Note:** In a production environment, we recommend separating any sensitive credentials from the CTS configuration files and loading them dynamically using environment variables, Consul KV, or HashiCorp Vault. Refer to the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/PaloAltoNetworks/panos/latest/docs#argument-reference) for a full set of provider arguments.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="tasks.hcl" hideClipboard>

```hcl
terraform_provider "panos" {
  alias = "panos1" 
  address  = "10.64.4.104"
  username = "admin"
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The `task` block defines a task for CTS to run when specific Consul services change.

`name` defines the task name.
`providers` defines the providers this task uses. In this case, the previously defined `panos.panos1` provider (aliased).
`module` defines the path to the Palo Alto Terraform NIA module. This module lets Terraform dynamically manage address group configuration when there are changes to specific Consul services.
`condition â€œservices"` defines the Consul services, when changed, would trigger this CTS task. The names must match the name of the Consul service you want to trigger the task.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="tasks.hcl" hideClipboard>

```hcl
task {
  name = "Create_DAG_on_PANOS1"
  description = "Automate Dynamic Address Groups based on service definition"
  providers = ["panos.panos1"]
  module = "github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/terraform-panos-dag-nia"
  condition "services" {
    names = ["web"]
  }
  variable_files = []
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

For more details about the configuration, refer to the [CTS configuration docs](/consul/docs/nia/configuration). For more details on the Terraform NIA module for PAN-OS devices, refer to its [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/PaloAltoNetworks/dag-nia/panos/latest) or [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/terraform-panos-dag-nia).
## Start CTS

Once you have configured CTS, start it using the `consul-terraform-sync` command. On startup, CTS will:

- download and install the Terraform providers and modules according to the configuration file you have provided (`tasks.hcl`),
- create Terraform files for the defined tasks, and 
- connect to Consul.

```shell-session
$ consul-terraform-sync start -config-file=tasks.hcl

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are
indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # module.Create_DAG_on_PANOS1.panos_ip_tag.this["web.web-1.dc1"] will be created
  + resource "panos_ip_tag" "this" {
      + id   = (known after apply)
      + ip   = "10.88.0.102"
      + tags = [
          + "web",
        ]
      + vsys = "vsys1"
    }

  # module.Create_DAG_on_PANOS1.panos_ip_tag.this["web.web-2.dc1"] will be created
  + resource "panos_ip_tag" "this" {
      + id   = (known after apply)
      + ip   = "10.88.0.103"
      + tags = [
          + "web",
        ]
      + vsys = "vsys1"
    }

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
module.Create_DAG_on_PANOS1.panos_ip_tag.this["web.web-1.dc1"]: Creating...
## ...
Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
[INFO]  ctrl: task completed: task_name=Create_DAG_on_PANOS1
[INFO]  ctrl: all tasks completed once
[INFO]  api: starting server: port=8558
```

CTS will continue running as a daemon and will automatically execute the `Create_DAG_on_PANOS1` task when it detects changes to the `web` Consul service.

## Verify NIA automation workflow

Once you have configured and started CTS, verify the workflow by clicking the **more...** link for your dynamic address group.

![PAN NGFW Dynamic Address Group IP Addresses tab](/img/nia/palo_alto_ngfw_dynamic_address_group_addresses.png)

Any time Consul detects changes to your Consul service, CTS will automatically register or deregister the IP addresses tags in your Palo Alto NGFW's dynamic address group.

## Next steps

CTS helps you automatically update your network infrastructure when your upstream infrastructure changes or fails. In addition, you can extend CTS to support CI/CD operations including [blue-green deployment by leveraging Terraform](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-feature-toggles-blue-green-deployments-canary-test) and service tags on Consul.

The Palo Alto NGFW and Panorama are compatible with various cloud providers, hypervisors, and containers. Combined with the extreme portability of Consul and Terraform, CTS makes the workflow portable with minimal changes, in any platform, increasing your flexibility and simplifying workflow migration across different solutions.
